This notebook calculates the overlap of answers given by all parties running for the election in Bremen 2019. 

It displays the parties as a network, the layouting is done with a spring algorithm, where spring-force is proportional to the answer-overlap.

Additionally a algorithm for finding clusters/hierarchy in networks has been used.
